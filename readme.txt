Squared'D Programming STL-Style UTF-8 String Class
2013-12-20

This software was written as part of a series of blog post on writing a UTF-8 string class that
behaves like std::string. It has all of the same methods as std::string and overloads the cast
operator so it can be cast to std::string and std::wstring. The class also supports C++ STL-style 
iterators. The iterators are constant only though because UTF-8 is a variable-sized type. It
wouldn't be possible to supply a mutable reference to any character. Because of this, the iterator
will always return an unsigned 32-bit int type or wchar_t on systems that use a 32-bit wchar_t type.
